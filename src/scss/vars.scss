| 
| Any global SCSS variables should be put in here. This includes global fonts, colors, padding, etc. Essentially if it is
| going to be used all throughout the site and needs to be set in a lot of places, you should probably make it a var here.
| That will assist in changing it in the future and gives the illusion of everything being organized!
