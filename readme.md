<h1>n-framework</h1>

n-framework is a PHP framework I created after requiring a custom foundation for existing company products. It was modeled after Laravel in many ways, and uses Smarty as a template engine. So why create a new framework and not use Laravel? Quite simply, it would take an entire rewriting of the existing code for several massive projects in order to do so, and we need to complete several requirements very quickly. Because of this, n-framework was built over time and was modular for many months, running new features, until eventually over a year, it became the entire foundation for the application.

Although many of the extensions are proprietery and not included in this package, the base version is functional and can be built upon to create web applications out of the box.
